# Anomaly-Detection

This project focuses on detecting anomalies within a dataset using the Isolation Forest algorithm. Anomaly detection is crucial for identifying unusual patterns or outliers that could indicate errors, fraud, or other significant deviations from normal behavior. The Isolation Forest model is particularly effective for this task as it isolates anomalies rather than profiling normal data points.
